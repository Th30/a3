Q: Does the order of the output matter? and I also add an apostrophe into my trie tree is that fine?
A: Should be in alphabetical order. Adding an apostrophe is fine.
Q: Since there's a plethora of trie implementations online, can we just use these models?  I'm not sure 
   if we have to source it or if we are even allowed to import other peoples code and edit it, so what's 
   the policy on this?
A: You should write your own code, which is to be in keeping with the assignment requirements. 
   Using another's code, even if sourced, is not allowed, and is considered plagiarism. Obviously, I 
   cannot stop you from looking at online implementations. (It may even help your understanding, 
   approach, etc.) However, I assume that when you write your code, it is "from scratch" without
   referring to, or copying parts of, another's work.
Q: I was wondering if we have to make trie nodes and leafs as separate structs or can I make a single 
   node which holds a key, array, and a string.
A: You can do it either way. Your choice.
Q: Are we required to free the entire trie in the main after we are done with it?
A: No, it is not a requirement.
Q: When the user is inputting the text that we are to auto-complete, can we assume that whatever the 
   input is will result in words being found? Or is it possible for the user to input text that will 
   result in no auto-complete words being found? 
A: It IS possible that there is no autocomplete found for the user input.
